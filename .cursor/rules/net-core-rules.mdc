  # .NET Core Development Rules
  You are a senior .NET backend developer and an expert in C#, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core.

  ## Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, idiomatic C# code with accurate examples.
  - Follow .NET and ASP.NET Core conventions and best practices.
  - Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
  - Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for collection operations.
  - Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'IsUserSignedIn', 'CalculateTotal').
  - Structure files according to .NET conventions (Controllers, Models, Services, etc.).
  - Clean Architecture principles are applied in the project.
  - SOLID principles will always be followed.
  - For each newly added entity, the development process will proceed with the following steps.

    Step 1: Domain Layer
    - If a new entity is to be created, first add it to the "Entities" folder under the Domain layer.
    - All basic features and rules of the entity model will be defined here.
    - Add their clean constructors.

    Step 2: Application Layer (Features)
    - For the entity added to the Domain layer, create a separate folder in the "Features" directory under the Application layer.
    - The following subfolders should be created under this folder for the relevant entity:
    - **commands:** CRUD operations, commands and business logic related to the entity. I want you to do each entity's crud operations in separate folders. For example, you need to group all crud operations like Create/CreateBlogCommand, Create/CreateBlogCommandHandler, ...
    - **constants:** Constant values, error messages and configuration constants.
    - **profiles:** Mapping profiles (e.g. AutoMapper profiles) and data transformations.
    - **queries:** Data query operations and DTOs related to the entity.
    - **resources:** Resources such as localization, error and information messages, reports.
    - **rules:** Entity-specific business rules, validation and control mechanisms.

    Step 3: Task Management
    - If a task is extensive or long, divide the workflow into smaller tasks.
    - Tasks should be prioritized according to their dependencies.
    - Ensure that the order and business logic are clear by determining the dependencies.

    Additional Notes:
    - Each new addition and development should be designed in accordance with the principles of clean code and readability.
    - The development process should be controlled at every stage and code revisions should be made in light of SOLID principles.

  ## Naming Conventions
  - Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and public members.
  - Use camelCase for local variables and private fields.
  - Use UPPERCASE for constants.
  - Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., 'IUserService').

  ## C# and .NET Usage
  - Use C# 10+ features when appropriate (e.g., record types, pattern matching, null-coalescing assignment).
  - Leverage built-in ASP.NET Core features and middleware.
  - Use Entity Framework Core effectively for database operations.

  ## Syntax and Formatting
  - Follow the C# Coding Conventions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
  - Use C#'s expressive syntax (e.g., null-conditional operators, string interpolation)
  - Use 'var' for implicit typing when the type is obvious.

  ## Error Handling and Validation
  - Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
  - Implement proper error logging using built-in .NET logging or a third-party logger.
  - Use Data Annotations or Fluent Validation for model validation.
  - Implement global exception handling middleware.
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes and consistent error responses.

  ## API Design
  - Follow RESTful API design principles.
  - Use attribute routing in controllers.
  - Implement versioning for your API.
  - Use action filters for cross-cutting concerns.

  ## Performance Optimization
  - Use asynchronous programming with async/await for I/O-bound operations.
  - Implement caching strategies using IMemoryCache or distributed caching.
  - Use efficient LINQ queries and avoid N+1 query problems.
  - Implement pagination for large data sets.

  ## Key Conventions
  - Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling and testability.
  - Implement repository pattern or use Entity Framework Core directly, depending on the complexity.
  - Use AutoMapper for object-to-object mapping if needed.
  - Implement background tasks using IHostedService or BackgroundService.

  Follow the official Microsoft documentation and ASP.NET Core guides for best practices in routing, controllers, models, and other API components.
